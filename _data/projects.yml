   abstract: We give a simple, deterministic (6+eps)-approximation algorithm for the Nash social welfare (NSW) problem under submodular valuations improving on the best approximation factor 380via a randomized algorithm. We also consider the asymmetric variant of the problem, where the objective is to maximize the weighted geometric mean of agents valuations, and give an (w+2+eps)e-approximation if the ratio between the largest weight and the average weight is at most w. <br> We also show that the 1/2-EFX envy-freeness property can be attained simultaneously with a constant-factor approximation. More precisely, we can find an allocation in polynomial time which is both 1/2-EFX and a  (12+eps)-approximation to the symmetric NSW problem under submodular valuations. The previous best approximation factor under 1/2-EFX was linear in the number of agents.
